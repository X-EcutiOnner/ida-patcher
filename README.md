## IDA Patcher
A user-friendly binary patch management plugin to replace Hex-Ray's IDA Pro default *Patched Bytes view*. 

Works on IDA Pro 7.4+ (python3), IDA Pro 7.0 (python2)

### Feature
- Import data (`Shift-I`), the invert of builtin Export data (`Shift-E`), supported input methods:
    - Hex string
    - Assembly
    - String literal
    - Binary file

- IDA Patcher: a more informative *Patched bytes View*
    - Display patch address / function name / size / patch bytes / comments
    - Use comment as a quick note for each patch

- Patch export / import (mainly depend on symbols)
    - Quite useful while migrating patches between different version of game binary
    - Auto detect patch validity while importing
    - Auto fixup branch target address with correct symbol address (experimental, now only works on aarch64 patch)

### Usage
Press `Ctrl-Alt-P` or navigate to `View/Open subviews/IDA Patcher` to enjoy.

Import data window can be opened by pressing `Shift-I` in *IDA View*/*Hex View*.

Patch import/export menu is on the right click menu of *IDA Patcher View*

### Install
IDA Patcher depends on [Keystone](http://www.keystone-engine.org/) to compile assembly, just follow instructions on their website. 

For Windows users, install by **Python module for Windows** is highly recommanded.

After installed Keystone, simply copy 'idapatcher.py' to IDA's plugins folder, it will be automatically loaded on the next time you start IDA Pro.

If you encountered some bugs, please feel free to file an issue.

**Happy patching!**
